      <div class="caption">This day meant so much to me. I was struggling with school and felt tired all the time, and this was an amazing day off. I was not expecting us to vibe so well together; I remember our first yap sesh right in front of the giant fish tank. I learned that you think and care so similarly to me. </div>

      <div class="caption">I was so confused by your texts and why you said no the first two times. I swear Iâ€™m never this persistent. You share my sense of humor and arenâ€™t put off by itâ€”something thatâ€™s not very common. You make me laugh and smile so much; you genuinely make me so happy!</div>

      <div class="caption">This night did not feel real. I still canâ€™t believe this is the only photo I haveâ€”itâ€™s kinda funny. I regret that it didnâ€™t last longer. But hereâ€™s to memories like this in the future. It might be rough and hard, but right now, it seems worth it. Thank you for being in my life and caring so much.</div>

      <div class="caption">I love playing Minecraft with you, and I want to play so many cool games. (BTW, accept my Steam request!)

Iâ€™m getting sleepy nowâ€”Iâ€™ve been coding for a bit too long. Oh, and I love listeing to all our songs too!

I feel so lucky just to even know you. You are so talented and smart, and I canâ€™t wait to see what you accomplish. Iâ€™m here rooting for you! So proud! ðŸ’–</div>
